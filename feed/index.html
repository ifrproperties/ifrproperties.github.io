This could also mean that you will be homeless in a matter of days. But <span class="bbtext">understanding the foreclosure process in Indiana</span> would make the entire event less damaging on your part. </p>
<p>Foreclosure is a legal process where a lender takes a property to pay off a loan. This is after a borrower stops paying his mortgage. It is a really stressful event, especially for the borrower, as he is not only piling up debts, but is also at risk of losing his home. </p>
<p>How foreclosure is handled different from one state to the next. If you live in Indiana, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We can help you in understanding the foreclosure rules and procedures. </p>
<h4>Judicial Foreclosure</h4>
<p><span class="bbtext">In Indiana, the most common foreclosure procedure is judicial</span>, where a foreclosing party or mortgage lender files a lawsuit in a bid to foreclose a home. You, the borrower, will then receive a letter from the court demanding that you make payments within the next 30 days to avoid foreclosing your home. In the event that you can’t repay your loan, the lender will be granted authority to sell your home through an auction. Once a property is sold, you should be ready for your eviction. </p>
<h4>Foreclose Notices</h4>
<p>For a foreclosure to get started, Indiana law requires that the right notices are sent to the parties involved. </p>
<div class="tick-list">
<ul>
<li>Pre-foreclosure notice is sent to you by the foreclosing party, informing you of their plans to file a complaint in court regarding your mortgage delinquencies. This will give you 30 days to settle your dues, find financial assistance or avoid a foreclosure altogether.</li>
<li>Summons and complaints are provided by the foreclosing party, notifying you of the lawsuit filed. Within 20 days upon receipt, you must file a written response with the court.</li>
<li>Notice regarding a foreclosure settlement conference usually comes with the summons, if the home to be foreclosed is your primary residence. This gives you an opportunity to participate in a conference where you and your lender can work out alternatives to foreclosure.</li>
<li>Notice of sale is posted by the sheriff at the courthouse before a property is auctioned off at a foreclose sale. You will be given the same copy as well.</li>
<li>Notice to leave will be sent to you after your property is sold. As an extension of a foreclosure action, this notice gives lenders the right to evict you out of your home.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>In Indiana, a <span class="bbtext">foreclosure starts with you being served a notice of pre-foreclosure.</span> </p>
<p>You will be given 30 days to repay your mortgage or avoid foreclosure, before a lawsuit is filed in court.<br />
If you are able to pay before the court enters judgment, your loan will be reinstated and the foreclosure procedure stayed. </p>
<p>A notice of sale will be sent to you, informing you of the impending foreclose sale of your home.<br />
Once a property is sold, you will receive a notice to leave, which basically translates to an eviction. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_1636" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://ifrproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/coupleBuying_sm.jpg" alt="Indianapolis Housing Marketing 2015" width="290" height="203" class="size-full wp-image-1636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Indianapolis Housing Marketing 2015</p></div>Although the U.S. housing market is said to continue to recover in the next years, experts can’t seem to agree on how high or strong the rebound will be. But 2015 is going to be a “buyer’s year”, according to some real estate observers, and there will be a burst in home sales. Situations can vary from one place to another, however, and so are the conditions of the real estate market. So, how will the <span class="bbtext">Indianapolis Housing Marketing 2015</span>, fare?</p>
<p><span class="bbtext">In 2014, Indianapolis was the only one of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. that posted a decline in property values</span>, which explains its strong closings. For some reason, however, the first quarter of 2015 is somewhat disappointing where new home starts are concerned. According to the 1Q15 survey by Metrostudy, the past 12 months showed just a total of over 4,200 new housing starts, which is 0.6% lower than last year. </p>
<div class="tick-list">
<span class="bbtext">But what exactly do the figures in the Indianapolis housing market tell us?</span> </p>
<ul>
<li>In Hamilton County, construction activity declined significantly by 18.3%</li>
<li>There is just a 1.6 month supply of standing new home inventory</li>
<li>There is an increase in new home starts in Hendricks and Marion County, 58.4% and 20.2% respectively</li>
<li>There were over 1,000 properties sold in the first quarter of 2015 with an average sale price of $137,628, based on the Marion County data</li>
<li>Most properties only stay on the market at an average of 91 days</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the information above, it is clear that both buyers and sellers can find balance in the <span class="bbtext">Indianapolis housing market</span>, especially now that it is on a slow and steady recovery. Still, the slowdown in the new home market can put a damper in some people’s enthusiasm. </p>
<p>Chris Huecksteadt, Regional Director of Metrostudy’s Indianapolis office, has an idea of what could be causing the slump. “Below average job growth and an apathetic consumer are giving cause for concern as we head into the heart of the selling season in the Indianapolis market. New home inventory is relatively low and the amount of available lot inventory in the market is also low overall, which may also be restricting any possibility for growth in the new home market.”</p>
<p>Home values are also on the rise, “faster than people’s income”, as what Chief Economist Lawrence Yuan said during an interview. This makes property buying less affordable for a lot of people. In Indianapolis, rising home prices is due to the increase in construction costs, development cost, and land and lot prices. All these caused values of new home to go above levels that might have enabled sellers to reach the largest pool of potential buyers. </p>
<p>Stringent credit standards are also seen as one of the causes that sales are slow, especially for first-time buyers. Although the Indianapolis housing market is not looking all that grim, what with new home starts rising steadily, despite certain factors at play, modest job growth, leaves little reason for prospective homebuyers to be excited about. Of course, if there will be a sustained job growth and strong wage increase, the housing market in Indianapolis can take a positive turn. </p>

This is usually not a bad thing, but something that you could end up regretting. So even if you are dealing with <span class="bbtext">we buy houses in Indianapolis</span> companies, you still need to take a step back and ask an important question — are they credible?</p>
<p>With scams going on around, online and offline, you should tread carefully when dealing with real estate transactions, even when you are about to sell a fixer upper. There is still money to be had on those dilapidated walls, anyway. </p>
<h4>How can you tell if you are dealing with something legit?</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>They have your best interest at heart</h4>
<p>The best house flippers and we buy houses in Indianapolis companies are out to help people live a better life by giving them access to the money they need without the hassle. This means they will help get rid of your property without listing it with a broker and making you wait some more. More importantly, they can give you peace of mind. So, anyone else who does the opposite is the wrong choice of company to deal with. </p>
<h4>They are honest, knowledgeable and reputable</h4>
<p>House buyers who only want to make money would not waste time sitting down and talking to you. But because the only way you will find out if you are working with a reputable buyer is to interview them, make sure they will take the time to speak to you. When you do get a chance, ask the right questions. Find out more about the services they offer, their investment philosophy, or how they plan to close a deal. </p>
<h4>Beware the tell tale signs</h4>
<p>There are different ways to tell if you are dealing with a credible <span class="bbtext">we buy houses in Indianapolis</span> company, but it is easier to spot shady tactics, if you know all about them. One example is the so-called ‘kitchen table closings’ when a buyer insists that you sign over the deed in a place other than with a title company, closing attorney or in a neutral third-party location. If everything has to be done right, a credible house buyer would not insist that you sign anything in your home or theirs. </p>
<p>Another tactic is to pressure you to a fast closing. Most house buying services will give you 2 to 7 days to consider your options before confirming your final decision. This is also one way to ensure that you get the best offer for your home, since market values can change in the course of days or weeks. If anyone forces you to make a decision straightaway, you might want to stay away. </p>
<p>Credible <span class="bbtext">we buy houses in Indianapolis</span> companies run an honest and ethical business, but there are some that are just out to make money at your expense. So spare yourself the hassle and just come to us direct. <span class="bbtext">We buy properties from people like you who need to sell fast.</span> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Short Sale vs. Foreclosure</h4>
<p><img src="http://ifrproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/foreclosure_sm.jpg" alt="Foreclosure vs Short Sale" width="360" height="254" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1472" /><br />
If you&#8217;re a homeowner, you&#8217;ve probably heard about the words “foreclosure” and “short sale” but have no idea what they mean. This isn&#8217;t really a problem if you have a relatively clean financial slate and are able to repay your mortgage and other debts on time. But, if you&#8217;re struggling to make your repayments on time and feel like you&#8217;re on the verge of a financial meltdown, it&#8217;s time to get more information about these terms and find out how they can affect you, your family and your entire life.</p>
<h4>What are short sales and foreclosures?</h4>
<p>These two terms might sound like they mean the same things, but they&#8217;re actually greatly different. In a short sale, you still own your home, but you&#8217;ll have to work with your lender and agree that you&#8217;ll sell the property at less than the amount of your outstanding mortgage balance. You also have to reach an agreement about what you&#8217;ll do with the unpaid balance (also known as the deficiency). Your lender can either be satisfied with the proceeds from your home sale and won&#8217;t ask for any additional payment, or he can demand that you still pay the deficiency.</p>
<p>A foreclosure, on the other hand, happens when you fail to meet your mortgage repayments and your lender decides to repossess your house and assumes ownership of it. He&#8217;ll then put it up for sale so he can recoup at least some of the money he had lent to you. He can also demand that you pay the deficiency, which means you won&#8217;t only be evicted from your property but will also have another debt to pay (while facing many other consequences).</p>
<h4>How will these affect you?</h4>
<p>Generally, short sales have fewer negative effects than foreclosures. Here&#8217;s a couple of lists to guide you:</p>
<h4>The Effects of Short Sale:</h4>
<ul>
<li>It can impact your credit score by only 50 or 100 points and affect you for only one year to 18 months.</li>
<li>It will usually be reported to credit bureaus as “Paid in Full” and most likely won&#8217;t appear on your credit history.</li>
<li>It will allow you to get a loan to buy another home right away, as long as you&#8217;ve been able to make your mortgage payments on time and have no record of payments that were late for 60 days or more. You&#8217;ll also get reasonable interest rates in two years or less and can have access to mortgages backed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) after 24 months.</li>
<li>Since it won&#8217;t appear on your credit history, it won&#8217;t have any adverse effects on your employment opportunities. This means you can continue with your job or look for a new one without having to worry about your financial records.</li>
<li>If the sale of your property goes smoothly and successfully, your house will most likely be sold near the market value and will let your lender recoup most of his losses. This makes him less likely to ask you to pay your deficiency (i.e., the difference between your mortgage balance and your home&#8217;s sale price). If he <i>does</i> ask you to pay it, the amount will be considerably lower and will be easier for you to repay.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Effects of Foreclosure:</h4>
<ul>
<li>It can damage your credit score by 300 or even more points and can affect your record for three years or more.</li>
<li>It will appear on your credit history for more than 10 years and will be viewed by the public, leaving a more or less permanent mark on your valuable record.</li>
<li>It will make it harder for you to get a mortgage for a new house and apply for other types of loans. For one thing, lenders will ask you to declare in your application if you&#8217;ve had a foreclosed home within the past few year. If you do, they&#8217;ll most likely charge you a higher interest rate than normal, and some might even refuse to give you a loan. It will take around 12 months or six years before you can get affordable interest rates from mortgage providers, and at least five years before you can have access to mortgages backed by the FNMA.</li>
<li>In many cases, it can have an adverse effect on your career. If you&#8217;re currently employed, your managers might see your home&#8217;s foreclosure as a reason to terminate you (especially if your job requires handling company finances). If you&#8217;re looking for a job, you might fail to impress future employers, particularly those who&#8217;ll run a credit check and take a close look at your financial history.</li>
<li>Homes that are foreclosed and sold as a real-estate owned property often get lower prices. This means your lender will most likely pursue you to pay the deficiency and leave you with an additional debt to pay.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Which one should you choose?</h4>
<p>As you can see from the lists above, short sales have a minimal effect on your credit worthiness, loan opportunities and personal reputation and almost zero impact on your current career and future employment. This is not the case with foreclosure, which can affect almost every aspect of your life. With these in mind, it&#8217;s easy to see that short sales are almost always the better choice between the two options.</p>
<h4>What should you do before going with short sales and foreclosures?</h4>
<p>Before making a decision, the best thing you should do is to meet with your lender and show you&#8217;re willing to negotiate. Doing this lets your lender know that you&#8217;re not running away from your obligations and you want to repay your debts as much as possible.</p>
<p>Ask your lender if you can opt for a short sale instead of having your home foreclosed. Many creditors will most likely agree to this so they won&#8217;t have to deal with the costs and complexities of conducting a foreclosure. But don&#8217;t be too complacent; instead, do everything you can to convince your lender that you have no other way of repaying your mortgage. Of course, show him that the amount you&#8217;ll earn from short selling your property is near the average market price. This way, he&#8217;ll see that he&#8217;ll be receiving a fair price from the sale and won&#8217;t be tempted to foreclose your house.</p>
<p>If your lender agrees to a short sale, ask if he&#8217;ll waive the deficiency so you won&#8217;t have anything left to pay; if he won&#8217;t agree to this, ask if you can at least come up with a plan that lets you repay the deficiency with small monthly payments. This way, you&#8217;ll eventually clear your debts while still having enough money to cover your daily needs and get back up on your feet.</p>
<p>Whether you opt for a short sale or a foreclosure, you need to prepare yourself and your family for the major changes that will surely take place in your life. Track your spending to see where you save; for instance, you can discontinue your cable TV service or reduce the number of times you eat out in restaurants. The money you save from these cost-cutting measures should be in your emergency funds, which you can use when you&#8217;ll move out of your property and look for another place to live. This way, you can survive during the first few months after your short sale or foreclosure, and you won&#8217;t have to rely on your credit cards or borrow money from friends and relatives to get by.</p>
<h4>Isn&#8217;t there any other choice?</h4>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s another choice! If your lender refuses to cooperate with you, one of the best steps you can take is to sell your house. This way, you&#8217;ll have full control over the entire process, ensuring you&#8217;ll sell your home at market value and at least recoup some of your investment.</p>
<p>Since you have debts to pay, it&#8217;s not avoidable to go through the traditional route. This takes up a huge amount of time since you&#8217;ll need to advertise your property, deal with real estate agents and look for potential buyers. Instead, look for other ways that let you sell your house in a quick and efficient way.</p>
<p>One such thing you can do is to find a company that buys properties as-is for cash. Since they won&#8217;t make any inspections and will purchase your house in its current condition, you won&#8217;t need to make any repairs, renovations and remodeling and you can therefore save a substantial amount of time, money and effort. You&#8217;ll also dispose of your home within the shortest possible amount of time, keeping short sales and foreclosures at bay and ensuring you can pay your debts on time.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry since finding a company who provides a house-for-cash solution isn&#8217;t difficult. If you live in Indiana, for example, just get in touch with us here at IFR Properties. As one of the firms in Indiana who provide cash for houses services, we specialize in helping customers who&#8217;d like to sell in their homes fast.

No matter how fancy your house looks or how strategically it is located in Indianapolis, there is still a possibility that it won’t sell.

<p>This refers to an agreement where you give your tenant a choice to purchase your home at the end of a particular rental period, and for an agreed option purchase price. While the agreement is in effect, you cannot offer the property for sale to anyone else, which may seem like a bad idea, especially if you prefer to make money right away. Still, there are benefits to this kind of arrangement.</p>
<h4>How does an Indianapolis lease option works?</h4>
<p>For instance, you have a house or condo rented for $2,000 with a 30% rent credit. This enables the tenant-buyer to put up a forced savings of $600 a month that will accumulate to $7,200 in a year. For a 5-year lease-option agreement, a tenant-buyer will be able to build up $36,000 of rent credit, enough to cover the cost of a property purchase.</p>
<p>If your home is a fixer-upper, you can also offer a rent credit, provided that the tenant-buyer will renovate the property.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to strike up a deal with Indianapolis lease option that will prove beneficial to both the lessee (tenant-buyer) and lessor (landlord).</p>
<h4>What are the elements of an Indianapolis lease option?</h4>
<div class="tick-list">
<ul>
<li>The buyer must first purchase the option. The fee is non-refundable, and usually costs 1% to 2% of the purchase price of the property. In the event that the tenant-buyer decides not to buy the property at the end of the terms agreed upon, the money remains with you, the seller, for the very reason that the option fee is not a deposit, but a purchase of an option.</li>
<li>The purchase price is agreed upon beforehand, although it can be decided when the option is exercised. In this case, the price will be based on the most current appraised value. It can also be equal to the price of a similar house within a neighborhood as of a date determined by an appraiser.</li>
<li>Set the amount of monthly rent payment that should be credited to the purchase price. This is usually negotiable, but is often 25% of the rent that should be paid.</li>
<li>The length of the lease option is typically 1 to 3 years. But it is highly recommended to agree for a longer term to allow the property to appreciate in value, which would be to the tenant-buyer’s advantage. The landlord-seller, on the other hand, has the right to raise the price of the purchase option annually, which is advantageous in a rising market.</li>
<li>The amount of the monthly lease payment is often equal to or slightly above the rent of in the fair market. It also matters if any of the payment will be credited towards the purchase price, as a way to reduce the purchase amount.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">It is recommended to agree on how the property will be used for the entire duration of the lease option — tenant-buyer occupies the house, sub leases it, or have the right to sell the option.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>When is an Indianapolis lease option advisable? </h4>
<div class="disc-list">
<ul>
<li>When you want to sell a property that has been on the market for a long time, or is difficult to sell for one reason or another.</li>
<li>When you don’t want to pay a realtor fee.</li>
<li>When you want to sell for a better price due to attractive terms offered to a buyer.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Before you and a tenant-buyer seal the deal, however, you must find ways to protect yourself. Know that the buyer will be doing the same thing, especially because lease options are often perceived as predatory, what with some property owners preying on tenants who have little chance of ever exercising the option realistically. Some also limit the terms to less than a year, limiting the possibility of a tenant-buyer to save money for a down payment or repair credit rating.</p>
<h4>So how do you protect yourself?</h4>
<div class="disc-list">
<ul>
<li>To guard against possible destruction of your home, check how many adults, children and pets will live in your home. That is, if you even would allow pets. You and the tenant-buyer must also agree about who will shoulder the maintenance and how much should be the late-rent charge.</li>
<li>Set a clear and definite option period. In the event of nonpayment of rent, the seller reserves the right to evict a tenant and end the option. This way, you can legally lease the property to someone else or sell it, if the previous agreement fails.</li>
<li>Always ask for a security deposit.  You will never know how a tenant would treat your home, or whether they would buy it at the end of the <b>Indianapolis lease option</b> or not. In case they decide against the purchase and damages your home at the same time, the security deposit should provide enough compensation. Better yet, include a provision for restitution in the lease option agreement for such an eventuality.</li>
<li>Make sure that the tenant-buyer pre-qualifies for a mortgage. This way, the chances of the option being exercised are higher or assured to push through. Although this particular requirement may limit potential lessees, this will ensure you don’t end up in square one of the lease-with-option-to-buy agreement.</li>
<li>Continue to pay for property insurance. As long as the lease option is still in effect, you should stay updated on property insurance payments. This is because you would still be responsible for your home if anything happens to it and the option is not yet exercised. As soon as the tenant-buyer exercises the option, he will then become the buyer in possession.</li>
<li>Ensure that the lease-option agreement contains typical clauses. At the start of the deal, certain aspects must be discussed beforehand. These include the purchase price, the option price, down payment that must be made when the option is exercised, the length of the lease term, the rate of monthly rental payment, the percentage of the rental payment that will be credited to the purchase, how and when the option is exercised, what should happen if the option is not exercised and the date of when the sale will close.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Sure, a lease option is not easy. It doesn’t offer any assurance either, but there are benefits to it.</p>
<div class="tick-list">
<ul>
<li>It takes off your hands a hard-to-sell property. Remember that real estate products tend to depreciate the longer they are on the market. Before you know it, people would want to buy your house for peanuts, and you might be tempted to agree, just so you can get rid of it.</li>
<li>It gives you an opportunity to re-evaluate your priorities. Say you no longer want to be a landlord. You can sell a rental property to any existing tenant you have who are willing to get into the lease-with-option-to-buy agreement. You can then use the proceeds of the sale any way you want.</li>
<li>It is a good way to attract buyers. Even in a recovering real estate market, buyers still have a hard time buying a home. With an <span class="bbtext">Indianapolis lease option</span>, they have a chance to become a homeowner in the long run. This will make your offer quite attractive to a lot of aspiring homeowners.</li>
<li>It offers an opportunity to make more profit. The agreement can be arranged in such a way that you can ask for a higher selling price, depending on the terms. Compared to normal transactions, a lease option promises more returns.</li>
<li>When the market is slow, you can still sell a property. No need to rush with a lease-with-option-to-buy agreement, anyway. And buyers are sure to grab the opportunity, considering the real estate market conditions.</li>
<li>It solves several financial problems. Compared to a normal lease, you can ask for a higher monthly rent payment through lease option. The amount you collect can go to your mortgage payment or help improve your cash flow. In the event that the tenant-buyer is responsible for property maintenance, you can take out one form of expenses off your hands.</li>
<li>It offers tax advantages. The Internal Revenue Code 121 gives you a tax exemption of up to $250,000, if you are the principal residence seller and you’re property qualifies for this arrangement. To enjoy this, you must own and occupy the property for an aggregate two years within a five-year period before a sale is made. For instance, you live for two years in your property before you decide to sell it through lease option for a two-year period. At the end of the lease-option term, the tenant-buyer pays for your home, and you still get to claim the $250,000 exemption. If you file jointly with a spouse, the tax exemption you receive will be doubled.</li>
<li>You get some up-front money from the option that a tenant-buyer purchased. In the event that the lease option is not exercised, you still get to keep the money, since it is non-refundable.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people are lucky enough to sell their home in Indianapolis by choice, by design and not because they are forced<img src="http://ifrproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/howToSell_sm.jpg" alt="How to Sell Your House Quickly in Indianapolis" width="341" height="361" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1470" /> by circumstance. Those who need to get rid of their property under duress has a lot more at stake, which makes house selling a major obstacle. Not to mention, an emotional rollercoaster. The good news is there are options to <b>sell your house quickly</b>, some of which can be hassle-free. Of course, like most dealings in the real estate market, you need to put in an effort to make things happen.</p>
<p><b>Price the property correctly</b></p>
<p>Negotiations are part and parcel of a real estate transaction, but you can better protect yourself against a low purchase price if you sell a property for the right price. This requires studying the local market and comparing your home with those within your neighborhood. If you want to make more profit, you might need to upgrade your home, the cost of which you must deduct from the total sale. What is important is that the initial pricing is right when you list your property on the market. The first 30 days is crucial, so don’t waste the opportunity by pricing your home incorrectly.</p>
<p>Why can’t you just sell it for a low or high cost? If it’s too low, buyers would think there is something wrong with a property. Too high, and they would think you are unwilling to negotiate, or even serious about unloading your home.</p>
<p><b>Improve your home’s condition</b></p>
<p>A few upgrades can go a long way. Sure, you need to invest in renovation, but it can be worth it. This is especially true if you do it right. By this, it means, renovating only those that promise returns, such as the kitchen, bathroom and home exterior. If you can only afford so much, it is best that you focus on the curb appeal. It is vital that you give buyers a reason to want to stop and check out the interior of your home, rather than just drive by and never look back. To save on interior improvements, simply change the paint to something neutral and stage your home the same way professional realtors would. To sell your house quickly, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paint the front door, add new sod, replace the mailbox, etc.</li>
<li>Update the landscape and exterior according to current style and market conditions</li>
<li>Apply a fresh coat of paint, preferably neutral in color, so buyers can picture themselves living and re-decorating your home, prompting them to buy</li>
<li>Add new fixtures or hardware, from door knobs to shower heads</li>
<li>De-personalize your home by removing whatever knickknacks, furniture items and home accessories that are reflective of your personality</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can afford to spend more on home upgrades, prioritize areas that will pay back. Every year, the list changes. So, for 2015, remodeling experts suggest prioritizing on new garage doors, a wood deck, exterior siding, attic conversions, kitchen updates, basement remodel, new windows and back-up power generator.</p>
<p>Although de-personalizing is highly recommended, you should leave some of the good stuff behind, such as a flat-screen TV, stainless steel kitchen appliances and other luxury furniture items. Then again, this might be unnecessary if you sell your home un-furnished.</p>
<p><b>Advertise actively and aggressively</b></p>
<p>Using Multiple Listing Services (MLS) is one way to get the word out. But if you want to <b>sell your house quickly</b>, you need to do more. While print and traditional marketing media still works, digital is more affordable and offers a wider reach. What are your options, then?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Leverage the web</b></li>
</ul>
<p>List your house on property or classified websites, such as Craigslist, Zillow, Backpage, etc. The more exposure a home has, the higher the chances of it selling quickly. Most of these sites are free and can be linked to other websites and social media. You can also list through IFR Properties where some of the best properties are sold. With a reputation like this, you have more chances of being viewed online.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use social media</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook, Twitter and the like are powerful tools that you can use to your advantage. Since every post you made can be viewed by your network, you can spread the word at just a mouse click. Without a doubt, your friend knows a friend who may be looking to buy a property in Indianapolis. So, if you want to <b>sell your house quickly</b>, use social media to get it out there.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Advertise on local print media</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Advertising on local newspapers may be more expensive than listing online, but not everyone is Internet-savvy. It is still worth it to promote your property to those who prefer to read the newspaper. By combining both digital and traditional marketing media, you open more opportunities for a quick sale, what with the wider reach they provide. Make sure to provide details that really matter, such as the price, call to action, best time to visit the property, and the best part of your home.</p>
<p><b>Open your home to buyers</b></p>
<p>Anyone looking to buy a house would want to check it out first. The moment you list your home, expect prospects to visit at different times of the day — early in the morning, at night or on weekends, and in short notice. Unless it is for sale by owner (FSBO), you might want to stay out of the way. This way, buyers can honestly discuss the pros and cons of your property. Also, realtors and buyers should not have to make an appointment to view your home. Make it easy for them to get into, and you are likely to <b>sell your house quickly</b>.</p>
<p><b>Remove any traces of pets</b></p>
<p>Some buyers are very particular about pets. Unless you limit your market to pet lovers, you should remove your pet and all of his paraphernalia, litter boxes and the like. As much as possible, a prospect should not even have to know that a dog or cat lives in your home.</p>
<p>If none of these seem to work, there other options that you can try. You can get them working on the background, or as a sort of a contingency plan. Closing a deal may not happen as quickly, but it can still help you get rid of your home, and make a good profit.</p>
<p><b>Short Sale</b></p>
<p>Also known as deed-in-lieu, a short sale is where you sell your home for an amount that is less than the mortgage you owe. This is one of the solutions to consider if you are already falling behind your home loan payments, and are not qualified for a refinancing. The term short sale is somewhat deceiving, since one transaction doesn’t always close quickly enough. Because it requires a lender’s approval, it usually takes a year or so to push through. Not quick enough, right? Moreover, the success of a deed-in-lieu could depend on the experience of a real estate broker to negotiate for the best deal.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to negotiate a short sale with a lender directly as a means to avoid foreclosure. This is where you sign over the ownership to your lender. The specifics would depend on the situation and the response of a lender. In some cases, you might be obliged to repay a portion of the loan after the sale.</p>
<p><b>Lease Option</b></p>
<p>Lease with option to purchase is a transaction where a seller agrees to put up a property for rent and give a tenant the option to buy the house or condo at the end of a specified rental period. Although it is often mistaken for a lease purchase, it is different in a sense that the tenant-buyer and seller are not bound to the sale. That is, the lessee doesn’t need to exercise the option if they can’t afford to. This is why most sellers ensure that a tenant-buyer pre-qualifies for a mortgage before engaging in lease option agreement.</p>
<p>For this arrangement to happen, a seller must first set an option fee, which is usually 1% to 2% of a property’s purchase price. Once a tenant buys the option, the deal is on. The amount of rental payment a tenant must make each month, depends on how much credit will be applied towards the purchase price, usually 25% of the rent payment. The lease period usually runs between 1 and 3 years, at the end of which a tenant must exercise the option. Ideally, the lease terms should be long enough to allow a tenant-buyer to save money for a down payment or repair credit score.</p>
<p>IFR Properties are actively looking for lease option properties, which gives you an option to <b>sell your home quickly</b>. Since they also buy a house for cash and in any condition, you can skip the part where you need to upgrade your home.</p>
<p>Whichever option you choose is really up to you. In a slow market, it pays to consider a lease option where you get to earn an income, enjoy tax benefits, and still make a sale in the long run.</p>
<p><b>Mistakes to Avoid When Selling Your Home</b></p>
<p>Say you are selling because you need to relocate. Don’t wait to qualify to buy a new home before you sell. You could end up renting or buying, which you did not plan on doing in the first place. Also, take the guesswork out of your property’s price. As already mentioned, you must price your home based on the fair market value. Ordering a fair market appraisal could help.</p>
<p>Most importantly, when closing a sale, you must include in your calculation your real estate agent’s commission if you hire one, advertising costs, professional fees of lawyers, closing agent, etc., gains or excise tax, and any other fees that could bring your profit down.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1446" src="http://ifrproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cashInHand_sm.jpg" alt="Cash for Houses in Indianapolis" width="355" height="247" /><span class="botext">Selling your house for cash</span> is still possible even in the current conditions of the real estate market. This is especially true in Indianapolis where the housing market is recovering and slowly getting back on its feet. Unfortunately, finding a buyer who will pay fast cash is no longer that easy. Hanging a “For Sale” sign on your front yard, and then waiting for potential buyers to knock on your door are no longer enough. With the stiff competition in the real estate market, <span class="bbtext">cash for houses in Indianapolis</span> requires a completely new different approach, one that would effectively work in the modern times.</p>
<div class="tick-list">
With the kind of work involved, <span class="bbtext">selling your house for cash</span> might not seem advantageous. But there are situations where the best solution is <span class="bbtext">cash for houses in Indianapolis</span>, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bbtext">When your home is about to be repossessed</span><br />
Rather than lose your home without gaining even a small amount of profit, might as well settle for a <span class="bbtext">quick house sale</span>. At a time when you are behind your mortgage repayments and negotiation with your lender is off the table, the next best solution is to find a buyer who will buy your home at the best price and help stop the threat of court proceedings, in the process. Sure, you still end up without a home, but not exactly penniless. Depending on your situation, you might have enough cash to tide you over.
</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">When you need to get out of deep financial trouble</span><br />
If you use your house as collateral, it can definitely help clear your debts. It can be your ticket out of a situation where you struggle to make ends meet. <span class="bbtext">Cash for houses in Indianapolis</span> will sell your home quickly and leave you with enough funds to deal with your financial problems, provided that it is sold at the best price, of course. But the decision to sell your home to clear debts must be done wisely. In the event that the final price on your home doesn’t cover all your liabilities, you might want to look for other financial options. What is the point of selling your home when you would still be unable to pay off all your debts?
</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">When you need to divide assets quickly</span><br />
Are you going through a divorce or separation? Do you want to avoid nasty arguments among your siblings with regards to an inherited property? Trying to sell your home when you are suffering emotional turmoil or when you are grieving will make the entire process doubly hard. This is why you should decide to dispose a property as quickly as possible and settle the estate. Dividing an asset between you and your estranged spouse or among your siblings is more convenient when it&#8217;s already liquidated. A <span class="bbtext">quick house sale</span>, however, does not guarantee that arguments will be avoided, but it can lessen stress to a certain degree.
</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">When you want little to no hassle in dealing with a real estate agent</span><br />
Selling through an agent may be convenient, but costs, delays and hassles should be expected. Since you can&#8217;t afford to dilly dally, you should opt for a quick house sale that will save you plenty of time and effort. Better yet, choose <span class="bbtext">property professionals</span> who specialize in <span class="bbtext">cash for houses in Indianapolis</span>. This way, you know exactly what to expect from them and them from you. You should know, however, that when your home is already listed, it is important that you inform your realtor that you are looking for a buyer on your own. This way, you will know what will happen if you <span class="bbtext">sell your home for cash</span>. Will his commission be waived or lowered significantly?
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>But even with property professionals to work with, getting <span class="bbtext">cash for houses in Indianapolis</span> could still be a struggle for some sellers. So if you want your property off your hands through a quick sale there are some things you need to remember.</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="bbtext">Always take a logical approach</span><br />
Emotions can easily get in the way when you are trying to <span class="bbtext">sell your house fast</span>, especially when your life and money are tied up in the property. Similar to when you are shopping for a home, falling in love the first time you’ve seen a house is a huge mistake. Logic must prevail, because allowing your emotions to get in the way will cloud your judgement, causing you to make an unwise decision. This is why you should think, rather than feel, when selling a property. Think about what really matters and what you will get from <span class="bbtext">cash for houses in Indianapolis</span>. Forget about sentimental value and think about the benefits you will get from a sale.
</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Avoid scams</span><br />
Fraudsters these days can look and sound like a reputable real estate agent. This is why you need to be careful in all your dealings. If a buyer offers to pay you with a check, decline the offer, for the simple reason that it defeats the purpose of <span class="bbtext">cash for houses in Indianapolis</span>. But say, you are desperate enough to accept it. Know that scammers who pose as buyers could suddenly change their mind after you have deposited the check and then ask for a refund. It is vital that you wait for the check to clear the bank before you give any refund to avoid being conned in giving away your money for nothing.</p>
<p>Other red flags that you should look out for is when a buyer passes up the opportunity to check out the property. It does make you wonder why anyone would buy something without first seeing it. Considering that the cost of a house is not that cheap, even if it’s is a fixer-upper, it pays to see what you are investing in.</p>
<p>You should also proceed with caution if a buyer doesn&#8217;t haggle. Although it happens that a buyer pays a full price for a property, it is a rarity. You may be thankful if the buying process is haggle-free, but there is no need to be complacent. Even those who buy fixer-uppers negotiate for the lowest price possible.
</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Evaluate your situation and property</span><br />
If you want to get a higher offer for your property, it is recommended that you carry out minor repairs and upgrades. Doing so will make your home competitive in the marketplace, just make sure that you don&#8217;t overdo it and end up spending more on repairs than the profit that you will make. It is also important that you strip your home of anything reflective of you and keep it neutral, from the choice of paint to accessories.</p>
<p>But what if you don&#8217;t have the time and money to repair your home? You can sell it fast for cash and without the need for property fixes, minor or otherwise. <span class="botext">IFR Properties is a leading provider of Cash for Houses.</span> We will buy your house As-Is in any condition. So <span class="botext">give us a call if you need to sell fast at 317-218-7653.</span> We will take your home off your hands without the need to fix any part of it.
</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Put the right price on your property</span><br />
When it comes to house prices; there a lot of factors that come into play, not just the amount of debt that you need to clear or the cost when you first bought it or have it built from scratch. The location does matter, as well as the house&#8217;s design, style and condition. So, if you don&#8217;t want buyers to think that your property is overpriced, research on <span class="bbtext">prevailing market prices</span>. You should also check out properties similar to yours in your neighborhood and find out how much they cost. Doing so will also determine how much of a discount you should give your buyers to sell your house quickly.

In fact, the demand for houses are growing because those who sold their homes are now looking for a place to move in, and are competing with first-time home buyers and those who are relocating. If the opposite is happening to a home you are trying to sell, there must be something wrong. Regardless of the location, if your <span class="bbtext">house isn’t selling</span> like it&#8217;s supposed to, you should seriously look into the various factors that come into play. Yes, there is more than one reason why your <span class="bbtext">property isn&#8217;t attracting buyers</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="bbtext">It is overpriced</span><br />
If your buyers think that you&#8217;re asking too much for your home, you probably are. And don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re only trying to get a lower asking price, because discerning buyers would look into the <span class="bbtext">real estate market</span> to determine how much your property is really worth, which, most of the time, may be different from what you think. They would look at similar homes in your neighborhood and make comparison. Because overpricing will work against you, it is important to <span class="bbtext">price your home right</span> from the get-go. Look to the market and houses in your neighborhood for ideas on pricing.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">It is in poor condition</span><br />
The need for extensive repairs is one of the reasons that a <span class="bbtext">house isn’t selling</span>. Majority of buyers prefer a home that is readily habitable by the time they move in, and some of those who are willing to take on a post-purchase project are sure to negotiate for a lower rate. Fixer uppers, on the other hand, are likely to sell for peanuts. So if you want your <span class="bbtext">home to sell quickly</span> and for the highest price possible, carry out repairs and renovations.</p>
<p>Of course, if you don&#8217;t have the time and money to repair your home, work with <span class="bbtext">property professionals of cash for houses</span>. At IFR Properties, we will buy your house regardless of its condition. We don&#8217;t require an inspection either, eliminating one of the hassles that come with selling a property.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">It is hard to find</span><br />
Even if a property is strategically located, it will not attract as many buyers, than when it is listed online. A majority of them search for potential options through web-based listings before they do the actual legwork. So, if they can&#8217;t find you online, you will have limited opportunities to sell. Word-of-mouth and print advertising are good, but combining them with digital marketing is better. Make sure to list your home on major real estate sites and Multiple Listing Service. This way, your home is guaranteed easy to find in the virtual estate market.</p>
<p>Now, in <span class="bbtext">listing a property online</span>, it is crucial that you add excellent photos. The lack thereof can send potential buyers away the same way that bad images would. Treat the entire process as any advertiser would — with emphasis on great presentation. Since buyers only have pictures to base their choices on, give them a good reason to choose your property.</p>
<div class="disc-list">
<ul>
<li>Use a tripod to take pictures to ensure stability and eliminate blurry images. This is especially true if your hands are not all that steady.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Turn on all the lights, even in broad daylight, to make your home appear warmer and more welcoming on photos.</span></li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Stage your home</span> exactly the way you want buyers to see during an open house.</li>
<li>The best time to take a picture of your home exterior is early in the morning, preferably dawn, when natural lighting is best and there are fewer distractions.</li>
<li>Get a professional photographer, if you’d rather not take a risk with your skills.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Process the images to get the best photos, but make sure to only adjust the lighting, soften or sharpen the picture, or remove any imperfections. Don’t go overboard with the editing to a point that the photo looks different from the real thing.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">It is so &#8220;you&#8221;</span><br />
It is not a crime to personalize your house. It is your home, after all. But if you want to sell it quickly, you must de-personalize it; strip it of anything that reflects your taste and personality. The idea is to let buyers picture themselves in your home, decorating and furnishing it according to their taste. If they can&#8217;t do this, they won&#8217;t be able to develop a sort of attachment with a property. They would relegate it as &#8220;not me&#8221;. Now, do you get the idea?</p>
<div class="disc-list">
But how do you de-personalize your home?</p>
<ul>
<li>Take down family photos, kids’ drawings and the like before property viewing.</li>
<li>Repaint the walls with a more neutral tone if they are painted with something else.</li>
<li>Remove souvenirs, knick-knacks and other items that belong in your personal collection.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Box up statement pieces that may only appeal to a number of buyers.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">It has unique features</span><br />
Did you put more importance on a recreation room than a bedroom? This may have worked for you in the past but not everyone would appreciate it, which explains why your <span class="bbtext">house isn’t selling</span>. This is especially true if your property is in a neighborhood suitable for families, which calls for a more practical and sensible house design. The same thing is true when you convert a garage into a bedroom, but the next buyer is looking for a place to house their vehicles. So if you added weird or unique changes to your property, you should undo them if possible.</p>
<p>In the event that you can no longer change the rec room into a bedroom or living space, be prepared to lower the asking price. Take into account the amount of money needed to make conversion and repairs, and deduct it from the original price.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Its exterior requires some TLC</span><br />
If your property’s curb appeal is non-existent, it doesn’t really matter if you’ve de-personalized your home and fixed the weird changes you’ve previously added. One look at the exterior and buyers would not be interested to check out what is inside your home. The initial impression is that if the outside looks bad, the inside could be worse. So make sure to improve your home exterior in any way possible — mow the grass, remove the weeds, fix the gutter, repair chipped paint, etc.</p>
<p>Know that some buyers check a property online, look up the address and then drive by it. If you want to <span class="bbtext">sell your home quickly</span>, you need to do something to make them stop and take a look around, rather than drive by and never look back.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">It is not presented in the best light</span><br />
Say your property has an awkward floor plan or you can’t do anything about the unique features you’ve added. Selling it would probably be next to impossible. Not exactly. Some buyers might be interested in something weird or unique. But if you want to appeal to a majority of buyers, make a list of positive aspects of your home and emphasize on them. Whatever negative aspects it may have, de-emphasize them or redirect the focus on something else. If you have lived in your house for a long time, then there must be something great about it. Sell that “something” instead — a newly renovated kitchen, the en-suite bathrooms, state-of-the-art home entertainment center, etc.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">It is sold at the wrong time</span><br />
Timing is just as important in buying and selling a property. This means the season may also have something to do as to why your <span class="bbtext">house isn’t selling</span>. Putting your property on sale during winter leaves you quite vulnerable to disappointments. Can you really expect buyers to go house hunting when properties are half-covered in snow, or when it is too cold for anyone to go outside? Although some buyers may view properties in winter to see how the houses hold up under harsh conditions, there are only a few of them who are brave enough to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not to discourage you from selling your home in winter, but take the season into consideration. Or, you can offer incentives or discounts for a buyer’s trouble. Just don’t expect a quick sale during these times.</p>
<p>But one of the biggest reasons your <span class="bbtext">house isn’t selling</span> is that you are doing it alone. It is understandable that you want to make as much profit as you can, and paying a real estate agent for their services and commission may not always work in your favor.</p>
<p>Well, you don’t really need to hire a realtor to sell your home, especially if you don’t have the time to apply for a mortgage or take out a loan. Simply refer to property professionals of cash for houses. IFR Properties buys houses in Indianapolis and other areas, regardless of its condition.

We will then call you after three business days to discuss your situation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://ifrproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pastDue_sm.jpg" alt="Avoiding Foreclosure in Indianapolis" width="320" height="206" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1435" />According to the U.S. Real Estate Trends &amp; Market Info, as of February 2015, 1 in every 1295 homes in the U.S. is foreclosed. And five of the states in the country experience an all-time high in foreclosure rates including Indiana. Here, 1 in every 871 properties is foreclosed. It is possible that the situation is more or less the same in Indianapolis, even if the city&#8217;s real estate market is on the rise. After all, a home owner&#8217;s capacity to settle <span class="bbtext">mortgage repayments</span> may not improve with the market conditions. But hope is not lost. If your home is under threat of this legal process, there are ways of <span class="bbtext">avoiding foreclosure</span>.</p>
<h4>Do not give up until the fat lady sings</h4>
<p>The idea that “it ain&#8217;t over until it&#8217;s over” has never been more applicable than when facing foreclosure. But the stress and all sorts of threats bombarding you from all directions makes it too easy to just give up and walk away. But it is also at times like these that you need to keep your wits about you and search for options. Remember that foreclosure can pull down your credit score significantly. You are likely to experience difficulty in purchasing another home as well, especially when a lender files legal action against you. In the end, giving up is not really an option.</p>
<h4>Be open and ready for negotiations</h4>
<p>The moment you know that you are about to miss a payment, negotiate with your mortgage lender. Leverage your status as a good payer to get your lender to <b>renegotiate the terms of your loan</b>. Know that banks don&#8217;t want your house, like really, they don&#8217;t want it. They already have too much on their plate, and the last thing they need is to embroil with auctions, local laws, court proceedings and other processes. All they really want is their money back, minus the hassle. So, you still have an opportunity to have your loan completely modified or be offered a forbearance. Just don&#8217;t wait to be too far behind on your <span class="bbtext">mortgage repayments</span> before you negotiate.</p>
<h4>Seek help from the government</h4>
<p>People have been <span class="bbtext">avoiding foreclosure</span> for a very long time and Uncle Sam has not turned a blind eye regarding the situation. In fact the Obama administration has launched several programs that will help homeowners like you who are struggling with their monthly mortgage payments and are at risk of foreclosure.</p>
<h4>Making Home Affordable Program</h4>
<p>This is a broad strategy that plays a vital part of the Obama Administration&#8217;s bid to help home owners in <span class="bbtext">avoiding foreclosure</span>. It is also a means to improve the U.S. economy and to stabilize its housing market.</p>
<div class="disc-list">
It offers several benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides an opportunity for your monthly mortgage repayments to be reduced</li>
<li>Get a loan with today&#8217;s low interest rates</li>
<li>An opportunity for homeowners to get out of homeownership while <span class="bbtext">avoiding foreclosure</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="tick-list">
Making Home Affordable also comes with different program options to suit a homeowner&#8217;s particular circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bbtext">Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP)</span><br />
This will lower your monthly mortgage payments by up to 31% based on your verified monthly pre-tax income.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP)</span><br />
This is the next best solution when a traditional refinance is no longer available to you because of the depreciation of your home&#8217;s value. Your existing mortgage will be refinanced to a more stable and affordable arrangement.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Home Affordable Unemployment Program (UP)</span><br />
If the reason you are unable to make repayments is because you are unemployed, you could get relief through UP. This will temporary reduce or suspend your mortgage payments for at least 1 year, giving you enough time to seek re-employment.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Principal reduction alternative (PRA)</span><br />
This provides another option for homeowners with underwater mortgages, where the value of their homes is significantly less than their loan amount. In this process, servicers and investors are encouraged to reduce the amount of money you owe on your home.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">FHA Special Forbearance</span><br />
This is another option of <b>avoiding foreclosure</b> when you are unemployed and have no other income source to make mortgage payments. Similar to UP, this extends your forbearance period for up to a year.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Second Lien Modification Program (2MP)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This modifies or reduces the principal amount of your second mortgage on the same property. You can use this even after your first mortgage was already modified under the HAMP SM.</p>
<p>The list above is not exhaustive, so whether you are unemployed, with an underwater mortgage or wants your loan to be modified or refinanced, there is a Making Home Affordable Program for you. Before you sign up for any program, however, it is important that you review each of their pros and cons. It is also vital that you choose an option that best works with your situation.</p>
<h5>Consider pre-foreclosure options</h5>
<p>There are also ways of <span class="bbtext">avoiding foreclosure</span> without going into more complicated processes. But you must be ready to move out of your home.</p>
<div class="disc-list">
<ul>
<li><span class="bbtext">Short sale</span><br />
This is also known as a pre-foreclosure sale where you can sell your home for an amount less than the outstanding balance of your mortgage. With the proceeds of the sale, you can pay off a portion or your entire unpaid mortgage. This makes an ideal alternative, if you are unable to modify your mortgage, or when refinancing is no longer an option.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Sell your home</span><br />
In the event that your property already has equity, you have higher chances of <b>avoiding foreclosure</b> when you sell your home. Traditional selling process that involves real estate agents, however, can be time-consuming and could cost you money that you may not even have. Your next best option is to sell your house for cash. IFR Properties offers just that. We will buy your home as-is or in any condition, eliminating the need for you to carry out minor repairs or upgrades.If you want to know if what we offer can pay all or a portion of your mortgage balance, call us at 317-218-7653. If you sign up for our VIP buyer’s list today, your property will have instant equity.</li>
<li><span class="bbtext">Rent out your home</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If your property can generate rental income that can cover your mortgage payments, renting out your home provides a great alternative. This will keep foreclosure at bay, and offers you another income source once you have fully paid your loan. Of course, you must be ready to face the headaches that come with being a landlord, such as problematic tenants, property maintenance and taxes.</p>
<h4>Reinstatement</h4>
<p>This is an option where you can avoid foreclosure and stay in your home, which, you have to admit, is a better option than anything else. But to be reinstated, you must be able to settle all your mortgage payments, including late fees, up to the day of foreclosure auction. If you can find a fund source that allows you to settle all your liabilities, reinstatement is the best course of action to take.</p>
<p>As you can see, <span class="bbtext">avoiding foreclosure</span> is more than possible what with all the options that you can choose from. You can even go as far as apply for a bankruptcy, but this will only stall a foreclosure, not clear your mortgage. Of course, if you prefer a quick sale with cash immediately on hand, give IFR Properties a call.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A significant amount of money is required to get started in almost all forms of investing. The same thing <img src="http://ifrproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/indplsRealEstate_sm.jpg" alt="Buying Wholesale Real Estate Properties in Indianapolis" width="350" height="255" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1428" />is true with real estate. The only difference is that you have an option to start small until you save enough money to grow your property portfolio. This is made possible through wholesaling real estate, a process where you buy a real property at a cheap price and then resell it to an investor or a house flipper.</p>
<h5>Buying Wholesale Real Estate Properties</h5>
<p>As you can see, in this type of arrangement, you can be the wholesaler or the flipper. So you can start from one end of the spectrum and then move to another, depending on how well your property investing activities go. The great thing about being a wholesaler is that you don&#8217;t have to spend money up front, if the investor you are selling the house to would be willing to pay for the property on your behalf. In this case, you simply act as the intermediary between the seller and the buyer. Regardless of whether you are the wholesaler or the flipper, there is one element that plays a vital role — location. In the wholesaling business, it is not enough that the area has plenty of fixer uppers; there must be plenty of opportunities to sell as well. Otherwise, flipping would be useless.</p>
<h5>Indianapolis Wholesale Real Estate</h5>
<p>Among the many states and cities in the US, Indianapolis is the ideal starting point, what with its abundance of <span class="botext">wholesale real estate properties</span> and a robust market conditions.</p>
<div class="disc-list">
<ul>
<li>It is the most populous city in Indiana, with a population that has seen a 15% growth over the last decade.</li>
<li>Indy, as it is fondly called, is the third largest city in the Midwest, and the 13th largest city in the US.</li>
<li>Surrounding counties around the metropolitan area have seen a modest and steady growth in real estate. Hamilton County real estate and Hendricks County real estate are two of the fastest growing in Indiana and the Midwest.</li>
<li>At the start of 2015 job growth in Indianapolis has increased by another 2.3%, bringing down unemployment rate to 5.8%.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>What is the significance of all these facts? Indy is the perfect venue for <span class="botext">wholesaling real estate properties</span>. The increase in population and jobs would mean more people are likely to move to Indianapolis, increasing the demand for housing or rental real estate. Now would be the best time to search for fixer uppers and flipping for profit.</p>
<h5>Indianapolis Real Estate Investments</h5>
<p>Moreover, the city has a reputation as ideal for real estate investment. Indianapolis real estate is listed by Fortune magazine as one of the cities were home values are expected to increase in the next 5 years. Forbes magazine rated it as the number one least overpriced major city, and was named the most affordable major market by the National Association of Homebuilders / Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index. It also took the number 9 spot in the list of the best places to buy foreclosed homes by Forbes magazine.</p>
<p>This only shows that Indianapolis not only have a good <span class="botext">wholesale real estate properties</span>, but a viable property market as a whole. So, whether you are wholesaling or into real estate investing, you should take your business to Indy.</p>
<p>When shopping for wholesale properties, there are matters you need to consider.</p>
<div class="disc-list">
<ul>
<li>Is the property foreclosed and then trashed by the owner?</li>
<li>Is it illegal or built in a hazardous area or a not-so friendly neighborhood?</li>
<li>Is the taxes fully paid?</li>
<li>How much does it take to flip it?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To avoid any problems, it is best that you perform due diligence. Any property issues can be avoided with extensive research. Better yet, work with property professionals who can lead you to the right direction. </p>
